###Introduction
This is an official release of the paper **Improve Multi Transportation Performances on Link-coupled Networks by Global Dynamic Routing**. 
The GDR is used to optimize transportation on the link-coupled networks.

### Description

The Models folder gives all the implementation code. 
The **MultiLayerNetwork.py** is the definition of link-coupled network model, 
The **Simulation.py** provides the Simulation process, and
The **Router.py** is an implementation of GDR.
The **main. py** implements GDR demo.
